######Formulation
The simulation area covers a square 1km x 1km. A mobile agent moves in this area according to the Random Way Point model with speed in [2 km/h, 4 km/h] and pause time [10 seconds, 1 minute]. This mobile agent is observed during three hours. Its initial position (x,y) is chosen uniformly in both the axes. 


######Activities
- [x] Code the Random Way Point algorithm
- [x] Compute the mean speed of the agent in time with the granularity of one minute with precision 5% on confidence level 0.05. 
- [x] Draw a diagram of the mean speed of this agent in function of time.
